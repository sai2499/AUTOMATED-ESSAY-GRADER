# AUTOMATED-ESSAY-GRADER USING MACHINE LEARNING(PYTHON)
Essay grading using MACHINE LEARNING.

The machine learns to score ESSAYS using MACHINE LEARNING.It takes different models of regression like LASSO,LINEAR etc to find the best optimum REGRESSION MODEL to score an ESSAY and marks accordingly.

It takes words count , verbs count as well as number of sentences etc. and plot them accordingly to find the best way to analyse an ESSAY.

We have used concept BOW,NLTK and REGRESSION MODEL to score the ESSAYS.

WHAT WE DID :

1. We made sure the spellings of the word are correct and if wrong then penalty is to be given depending on the number of words written wrong.
2. We made sure the two sentences having same meaning but written differently are given same marks.
3. We made sure the more good use of language is provided more marks.
4. We used different models to find out which model suits better to give a better score.

# CONCLUSION
LASSO REGRESSION provides much better way to judge score of ESSAYS.
